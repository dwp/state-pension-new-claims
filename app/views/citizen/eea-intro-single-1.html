        Claiming a pension from France.</h1>

<p>You may be entitled to a European Union (EU) pension based on the time you lived or worked in France.
</p>

<p>If you want to make a claim for your pension from France, we will send some forms to complete.</p>

<p>If you have already claimed your pension from France, you do not need to claim again.</p>

<p>EU pensions do not affect how much UK State Pension you will get.</p>
