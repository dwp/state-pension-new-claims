<p>You may be entitled to EU pensions from France, Spain and Germany based on the time you lived or worked there.</p>

<p>If you want to make a claim for your EU pensions, we will send you some forms to complete.</p>

<p>If you have already claimed your EU pension from a country, you do not need to claim again.</p>

<p>EU pensions do not affect how much UK State Pension you will get.</p>
